# null-demos
LCD code by Matt Way.

## Changes:

### lcd-imagedata:
- color variation (this is applied last)
- invert colors
- shift (rotate) hue
- color fill

### gif-file-loader:
- manually change fps

## Notes:

Recommend using small .gif dimensions to increase performance and also to achieve the "old screen" look. For reference, the .gif in the screenshot has a width of 100px. You can resize a gif at https://ezgif.com/resize
